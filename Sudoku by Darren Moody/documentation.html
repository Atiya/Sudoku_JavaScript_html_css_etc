        <li>Game grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When the <b>gameGrid.html</b> page is loaded close to everything for the "view" side
				of the game is instantiated, including the game grid, all starting with the 
				<i>buildDomSudokuGrid()</i> function. This is the function that generates the Sudoku 
				game grid using CSS from my <b>style.css</b>. The CSS file is referenced in the 
				<b>gameGrid.html</b> head. Using innerHTML and CSS, this function gives each of the 
				81 cells of the Sudoku grid it's own unique div class name, and ID. 
            </li>
        </ul><hr>
        <li>
            User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Before a game begins, and before sudoku table is populated with numbers,
				the user has to select a difficulty option in a dropdown select menu. 
				Selecting a difficulty starts the game in motion, especially those things kept track of
				in and related to the <b>model</b> side of the game. Also using <b>buttons</b> 
				the user can start a <i>New Game</i>, <i>Check Answers</i>, <i>Clear</i> their answers and 
				start the current game over, or choose to <i>Solve Puzzle</i>.
            </li>

            User input in the form of mouse clicks
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When the sudoku grid is created, another slimmer grid of cells is created just below,
				which is called the <i>keypad</i> because it serves as a replacement for the number keypad.
				The keypad will show all of the possible answers for a cell on the sudoku grid when it is 
				clicked on. In order to place an answer in the sudoku grid cell the user must click on 
				one of the possible answer cells in the keypad. There are 10 cells in the keypad grid, one 
				for a blank to erase an answer when clicked, then nine more for numbers 1 through 9. 
            </li>

            Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <i>buildDOMSudokuGrid()</i>, <i>displayHighScoresJSON()</i>, <i>displayXMLPlayers()</i>,
				<i>checkBoard()</i>, <i>finishGame()</i> functions and several others use <b>innerHTML</b> 
				to create new elements or modify existing elements such as divs, Sudoku grid cells, 
				classes, XML and JSON data, and more.  
            </li>
        </ul><hr>
        <li>
            Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on the grid page
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Along with the rest of the <i>view</i>, when <b>gameGrid.html</b> is loaded a "fabricated"
				high scores list is displayed using a JSON file and a new <i>highScoresDIV</i> created 
				using <b>innerHTML</b> in the <i>loginfo</i> div to the right of the Sudoku grid. Just above that, a "fabricated" list of frequent players is displayed in the same div.
				The <i>displayHighScoresJSON()</i> function uses an <b>XMLHttpRequest</b> to load the 
				high scores list from the file I created <b>highScores.json</b>. 
            </li>

				Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage
			</li>
        <ul>
			<li>
            I incorporated a few audio elements to play in 3 different places; if a user checks their 
			answer and there is a wrong answer an "OhNo.wav" sound is played, or if the user checks their
			their answers and everything is good a "Yes.wav: sound is played, and also when the user 
			completes a puzzle, winning the game a "Cheering1.wav" sound is played. I used <b>HTML 5 audio
			tags</b> for each one. The audio tags are located towards the bottom of my <b>gameGrid.html</b>
			file and are played using the <b>play()</b> functionality in the appropriate places in the code.

            Game Logic
        </li>
        <ul>
			<li>
            <b>Random puzzles</b>: I know we didn't need to generate random puzzles but I thought it 
			would be a good feature to have to give the game a good replay value. So when a user
			selects a difficulty and starts the game in motion, a new Sudoku puzzle is generated
			by the <i>generate()</i> function, using a backtracking algorithm. 81 random numbers 
			are produced and checked by the <i>cellConflicts()</i> function one at time. Each number
			is checked for conflicts in the row, column, and miniGrid (3x3 tables within the Sudoku table)
			where it would be placed. If the number does not work the loop backtracks by setting 
			i = i - 2 (2 because the loop increments by one) and tries a different random number. Once 
			a number that works is found it is added to a new game puzzle array.<br></br>
			The new puzzle is then passed to a function which randomly pulls out a certain number of 
			numbers from the puzzle array based on the difficulty. The harder the difficulty, the higher
			the amount of numbers pulled out. The puzzle is then loaded in to the game grid created in 
			the "view". I mentioned how the user inputs their answers in to the puzzle in the "input in the
			form of mouse clicks" section. The same logic from the <i>cellConflicts()</i> function in 
			the prototype object is used to populate the keypad with possible correct answers for any 
			cell on the Sudoku grid when clicked on. So this "checking for conflicts" logic is used to 
			generate a new puzzle, populate the keypad, check the user's answers, and check to see 
			if the user has won when the puzzle is completely filled up.
