        <h2>For my Game project using a Grid</h2>
        <h2>I will be creating my own version of the game Sudoku!</h2>
        <h2>This version will use the MVC design pattern and will contain a Model and a View</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Model contains information about the game-play, state of the game, the parameters and objects <br>
                (game pieces) of the game.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For the case of Sudoku, I will have cell objects, interactive buttons, and a drop-down menu.</li>
                <li>Each object will contain parameters as needed for the gameplay.</li>
                <li>The "game pieces" will be numbers contained within the cells of a table.</li>
                <li>The Model for this game will contain the information for all of these things.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The View contains functions, parameters and information about how the game is displayed.</li>		
            <ul>
                <li>The Controller will be contained within the View.</li>	
                <li>"For this assignment, don't worry about separating the controller from the view."</li>
                <li>In a nutshell, the view produces the game interface, or game-board design.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

    <p>For my Sudoku game I will be generating a Sudoku table that is made up of 81 separate cell objects 
        in a 9 x 9 table. The 9 x 9 table will be made up of 9 separate 3 x 3 tables, which I will call mini-grids.
        My functions for generating the table will be passing objects as parameters, which objects 
        will contain the parameters for creating the table size, as well as states contained in arrays. The 
        parameters contained in the objects will be shown below.
    <h3>Playing this Version of Sudoku</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The player will see a blank game-grid and other elements of the game's interface</li>
        <li>The player must then select a difficulty from the drop-down list of difficulties and a new puzzle of that difficulty will auto-load on selection.</li>
        <li>A certain amount of the blank cells on the game-grid will be filled in automatically.</li>
        <li>The player can select any empty-cells on the game-grid and possible correct answers for that cell will be given in a separate clickable grid called the keypad.</li>
        <li>The player clicks a check answers to check their answers.</li>
        <li>If all the answers are correct a message will say "everything is good so far", or if there is a conflict the conflicting cells will be highlighted in red".</li>
        <li>Once all of the numbers have been filled in and all of the answers are correct the game is over and a "you win" message will display.</li>
        <li><h3>Winning the game: </h3></li>
        <li>In order to win at Sudoku you must enter the numbers 1 through 9 in each row, column, and mini-grid (3 x 3 table<br>
            within the larger table making up the entire game board). You may enter the numbers in any order but you cannot<br>
            repeat the same number twice in a given row, column, or mini-grid. For example, if there is already a 6 in a given row,<br>
            then there must not be another 6 in the same horizontal row (across the entire board), vertical column (across the entire board)<br>
            or in the same 3 x 3 mini-grid, or else one of the sixes must be in the wrong place...this is called a "conflict"!!! <br>
            Once you have filled in the entire Sudoku Game Board with numbers 1 - 9, having no conflicts, YOU WIN!</li>
    </ul><hr>	   

    <h3>The Model (SudokuModel.java)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>NUM_CELLS is the number of cells on the gameboard (81, 9 * 9)</li>
        <li>Numbers possible for each cell are (1 - 9)</li>
        <li>A 0 will represent a blank cell </li>
        <li>I will make an attempt at generating new game puzzles.</li>
        <li>There will be 4 or 5 difficulties to choose from ranging from easy to very-hard.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Objects (for assignment 3)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SudokuModel</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains information about the model</li>
            <ul>
                <li>There are 9 mini grids of 3 x 3 each within one large grid of 9 x 9. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>GridCellObject</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains information about a given cell</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For example: {"inUse": false, "number": 7}</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose Difficulty</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Will give a <strong>drop down select list with difficulty options.</strong></li>
            <li>I will produce the difficulty list using "select" and "option" html tags.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Numbers(my "game pieces")</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The grid will be populated with numbers</li>
            <li>The element objects associated with each number must have listeners to sense when they've been clicked</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <strong>Functions</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>CreateGameGridInHTML() will generate the html for the grid</li>
        <li>CreateGameBoardInHTML() will fill in the table with .
            <ul>
                <li>I will have an array of 81 numbers. I will populate the puzzle with this array and then remove a certain amount of numbers based on the chosen difficulty level</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Need a buildGameGrid() function which will create the table in the model</li>	
        <li>I will need to handle each button with an onClick function in JavaScript - example function buttonName.click(event)</li>
        <li>I will also handle cell click events in the same way as the buttons</li>
        <li>I will need methods to handle mouse overs and selections
            <ul>
                <li>MouseOver or MouseClick functions will take grid cell events as parameters.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>MouseOver or MouseClick functions should have some nice transitions for cells in the grid (shading or something)</li>
        <li>MouseOver or MouseClick functions should return the value in the cell that was selected</li>
    </ul><hr>
